This is How to Compile and run my code:
__________________________________________________
----> On Firga Computers:
	Run the "Run.bat"

----> On other Computers:
	Run the "Compile.bat", and open "Controller.java" with an IDE and run it

----> If Both of those give errors:
	Open all .java files in an IDE, compile them all, and run Controller.java

This is what I did for Bonus Marks:
__________________________________________________
*Greatly improved the GUI
	-backgrounds
	-buttons(that light up and are clickable)
	-many graphics for enemies
	-many graphics for bullets
	-power up icons
	-good looking shooter
	-Many different screens
		+welcome screen
		+option screen
		+high-scores screen
		+upgrades screen
		+play screen (in the play screen the background is selected randomly from a few pictures and the background pans with the players movements)
		+instructions screen
	-My game is also completeley resizeable, i need only change one number in the code and everything will scale with this number(This could potentialy be read 		in)
*I used interface and class inheritance
*I added many different types of enemies to the game, including enemies that aim at you and try to shoot you, and bosses
*I added many differnet types of bullets to the game, their damages ranging and some are "homing bullets" i.e. they change thier trajectory to try hit the player
*I have progressively harder levels (including Boss levels)
*As mentioned above, I have a high score screen
*I have added a hit points system (every entity has hit points)
*I have added an extra lives system
*Enemies can shoot back (many different bullets)
*I have added moving and upgradable bunkers
*I have added many power ups:
	-increase fire rate 
	-shoot multiple bullets at a time
	-slow time
	-increase your damage
	-shield to protect you from enemy fire
	-and some combinations and variations of these)
*I added music to my game (a few tracks that loop)
*I added sounds to my game (there are a few but the volume levels of the music make it difficult to hear)
*And with the obove mentioned sound adding, I made my own Class to handle all sounds and music for the game as StdAudio was giving too much trouble
*I added an upgrades/ store system where you get currencey for completing each level and you can use this currencey to upgrade your ship:
	-increase Fire Rate
	-increase bullet Dammage
	-increase hit points
	-increase the number of bullets you shoot
	-Fasten your perception of time (slow the enemies and thier bullets)
	-increase the chace that your bullets will phase though the bunkers, the hit points of the bunkers, and the width of the bunkers
	-buy more lives
	-increase the duration of the powerups
*I added different controll systems to the game, ie you can shoot and move with the keyboard or you can choose to move with the keyboard 
	and aim and shoot with the mouse
