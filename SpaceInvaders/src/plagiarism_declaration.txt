This declaration is applicable to The Space Invaders Project of Computer Science E214 in 2015 

By including this document as part of my assignment submission, 
I, Elan van Biljon, (Student number 18384439) declare the following:
[BEGIN DECLARATION]
Stellenbosch University Computer Science Assignment Declaration 
---------------------------------------------------------------
 

I know that using another person’s ideas (including written work and source
code) and claiming them as my own constitutes plagiarism. I am aware that the
potential penalties for this offence, 
as specified in the university’s policy
on academic integrity, may include expulsion from the university and other
serious consequences. 
 
1. This submission is entirely my own work, 
excepting the inclusion of
resources explicitly permitted for this assignment, and assistance as noted in
the following item. 


2. My submission acknowledges the source of all libraries and external sources
used, and identifies any other students and/or staff (including demis, tutors,
and lecturers) 
with whom I have discussed this assignment, as well as the
extent of those discussions. Students and staff who helped me, or whom I
helped, with debugging, should specifically be listed, 
as well as what portions
of the code were involved.  (Note that, unless explicitly stated otherwise,
submissions or solutions to assignments in previous courses at this university

or any other educational institution which correspond to (significant portions
of) this assignment may not be used as external sources ­ in particular, do not
look at or use solutions 
to assignments from previous years.) 

3. I have not allowed, and will not in the future allow, anyone to copy any
portion of my work, or give them access to it in any way, since they may 
have
the intention of passing it off as their own work (whether as is, or in a
modified form).  In addition, I will not make my work publicly available in any
way, including posting my code
 in public source code repositories or forums.
(You may, however, allow someone to look at selected portions of your code for
the purposes of debugging, but you may not make the code available 
to him/her
otherwise.) 

4. I have not and will not facilitate plagiarism, such as by distributing any
written work or source code created by a fellow student. 

5. 
I understand that any code I submit may be inspected for plagiarism
detection (either manually or by automated systems) and be retained for
detecting plagiarism in other courses.

Acknowledgement of sources
--------------------------

Demis and Lecturors saw my code and discussed parts of it with me, I also let my friends see my code and helped them with theirs, 
I also used programs we wrote through out the semester (such as Quick.java), some standard libraries (Timer, ArrayList, etc), stdlib.jar.
I got my sound effects from "soundbible.com" and my music from "newgrounds.com".
I got my pictures mostley from "opengameart.org" but edited many of them with Gimp to try make my own art.
I also watched a few tutorials online and read many StackOverFlow posts.
I amy have also gotten some pictures or sounds from the following websites (cant remember all my sources)
